# Wur_LPSolve
edited version of LPsolve that compiles on the wur altschul server. Made to solve a issue that occured on the Wageningen University server. When trying to compile a error would pop up mentioning that the variable FALSE was already defined. With some edits it was changed and should now compile.

LPSolve is not owned by me. check http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/ for the original source code.
